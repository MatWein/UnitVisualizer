<!-- Plugin description end -->

After installing the plugin you will see something like this in the project view:  
![Alt text](/src/test/resources/screenshots/Screenshot1.png?raw=true "Screenshot 1")

Simply move your classes and its tests will be moved automatically:  
![Alt text](/src/test/resources/screenshots/Screenshot2.gif?raw=true "Screenshot 2")  

The plugin will also show you icon layers on method level. So you can see if specific methods are tested and jump from method to test method.  
![Alt text](/src/test/resources/screenshots/Screenshot3.gif?raw=true "Screenshot 3")
